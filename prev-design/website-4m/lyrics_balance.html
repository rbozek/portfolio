</br>
What were you looking for stuck in a daze?</br>
Are you wasting all your time being polite</br>
saying you don't want anything anymore?</br>
</br>
I want to...orbit</br>
But it's ok</br>
Walking around like nobody knows it anyway</br>
</br>
Is this what you were asking for?</br>
A way to lose?</br>
You'll never be bored again</br>
and you won't care about anything anymore</br>
</br>
I want to...orbit</br>
But it's ok</br>
Sneaking around so nobody notices anyway</br>
</br>
Oh yes I'll pine away my time</br>
and burn down the trees and waste my days</br>
Oh, lately you can see that we were meant to be</br>
Still you smother me</br>
</br>
I want to...orbit</br>
But it's ok</br>
Walking around like nobody knows it anyway</br>

</br>
Glint of light in your father's eye</br>
Strung him up when they say he lied</br>
Only one who thinks that you're right</br>
Nothing more than another crime</br>
</br>
Wait</br>
</br>
Hint of life in the brother's eye</br>
Save it all for another time</br>
Only one who thinks that you're right</br>
Nothing more than another crime</br>
</br>
Wait</br>
</br>
I run away</br>
</br>
Twist the knife in your neighbor's side</br>
Live or die...his time to decide</br>
Save it all for another time</br>
you're the one who thinks that you're right</br>
</br>
Wait</br>
</br>
I run away </br>

<a class="lyric_title" name="jjjoe">Jjjoe Mamma’s Strut</a></br>
</br>
I’ve got a little strut in my stride</br>
Strut in my stride</br>
</br>
Walkin’ my walk in a good way </br>
Getting funky on a sunny day</br>
We are all here right now where we are</br>
All we have to do is get funky</br>
Hit the beats and the funky sound and you ve got no where to go but down</br>
There’s one thing that I always say it's that I got some funk for y'all</br>
</br>
I’ve got a little strut in my stride</br>
Strut in my stride</br>
</br>
Once you get all those funky beats you’ve got nothing to but boil</br>
Plus the water and you pour and you got something more</br>
When you get the funky beats you have got nothing to do </br>
This is what I call it baby</br>
</br>

</br>
You always told me how to open your eyes</br>
The world is wicked now but it ain’t no surprise</br>
So chew your bubblegum as the days keep passing by</br>
What are you going to do with your life?</br>
</br>
Just sweet talk, sweet talk</br>
Sweet talking your mind</br>
</br>
Raindrops fall from a cloud as a boy jumps in a puddle</br>
Mama yells out loud while this boy gets into trouble</br>
Many years are passing now, the boy still don't know how</br>
It’s a good thing his mama showed him how</br>
</br>
Just sweet talk, sweet talk</br>
Sweet talking your mind</br>

</br>
Strap on your blue velcros, I’m gonna take you for a ride</br>
Get yourself a hang glider we're gonna get you high</br>
Another Sunday traveler with nothing left to lose</br>
You're gonna find out for yourself that what he said ain't true</br>
</br>
It's got to be karma, meditate it for me </br>
It's got to be karma, metaphysically </br>
It had to be karma, meditated for me </br>
It had to be karma</br>
</br>
Oh Abu its easy once you see</br>
All you ever do don’t me a thing to me</br>
So live your life and say your last goodbye</br> 
All you find leaves nothing to surprise</br>
</br>
Like those have gone before you are so quickly to deny</br>
Follow the leader like a careless passer by</br>
Short on these equations...y the x? and what the y?</br>
Never saw the reason y the purpose had to die</br>
Strap on your blue velcros, I’m gonna take you for a ride</br>
Get yourself a hang glider we're gonna get you high</br>
Another Sunday traveler with nothing left to lose</br>
You're gonna find out for yourself that what he said ain't true</br>
</br>
It's got to be karma, meditate it for me </br>
It's got to be karma, metaphysically </br>
It had to be karma, meditated for me </br>
It had to be karma</br>
</br>
Oh Abu its easy once you see</br>
All you ever do don’t me a thing to me</br>
So live your life and say your last goodbye</br> 
All you find leaves nothing to surprise</br>

</br>
When I see them waving on</br>
What I see when looking from the outside of town</br>
Ed was a man who'd rest his head on my door</br>
He thought that it was tied but he never knew the score</br>
</br>
One more time for old time's sake</br>
Help or heal or steal this place</br>
One more time for old time's sake</br>
Say...</br>
</br>
What could be went way beyond</br>
what would be when turning from a smile to a frown</br>
Tank was a man who'd rest his head on my floor</br>
who thought that it was tied but he never knew the score</br>
</br>
One more time for old time's sake</br>
Won't help or heal or steal the place you used to call your own</br>
but now you see it all</br>
One more time for old time's sake</br>
Won't laugh or smile or find the place you used to call your own</br>
by what could be...</br>

The weight is fleeting</br>
A light debate in meaning</br>
Fortunes made in being</br>
Portion of the whole</br>

For</br>

Fortunes made in meeting</br>
One without a soul</br>

</br>
Sometimes I wonder is it going to last?</br>
I think she wonders but I let time pass</br>
Shady eyes look at me and I look right back</br>
You won't find the answer in the bottom of a broken glass</br>
</br>
She made me laugh </br>
She made me cry all night</br>
Why did I start at all?</br>
I want to live girl</br>
You know I don’t want to die</br>
Can't even think at all</br>
</br>
She don’t understand</br>
She don’t know at all</br>
She don’t understand</br>
Quick to the fall</br>
</br>
My shirt is blue, my heart is black</br>
My game is tired</br>
I ain't never coming back</br>
I see this girl</br>
She sits and cries</br>
I cannot help but feel her pain</br>
</br>
She made me laugh </br>
She made me cry all night</br>
Why did I start at all?</br>
I want to live girl</br>
You know I don’t want to die</br>
Can't even think at all</br>
</br>
She don’t understand </br>
She don’t know at all</br>
She don’t understand</br>
Quick to the fall</br>

</br>
Nothing like stating the obvious</br>
Take you right down to the bone </br>
Telling me what I’m coming here to see</br>
While you say that and it's your fault</br>
Overstating and outside outside</br>
Outside of the box</br>
Coming way out of left field</br>
Never known at all</br>
</br>
She sees clearly black and white</br>
but its grey down in the hole.</br>
</br>
Nothing like stating the obvious</br>
While your bricks try to catch your falls</br>
Telling me what I’m coming here to see</br>
About what’s already known</br>
Insecurities are obvious</br>
Going on and on</br>
Never coming raw</br>
</br>
She sees clearly black and white</br>
but its grey down in the hole.</br>
</br>
Wait, in time you will find all our time</br>
